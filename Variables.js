//JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values.

var x = 5;
var y = 6;
var z = x + y;

/*From the example above, you can expect:
 x stores the value 5
 y stores the value 6
 z stores the value 11*/

/*JavaScript Identifiers
All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.

These unique names are called identifiers.

Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).

The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:

Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
Names must begin with a letter
Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial)
Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables)
Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names
JavaScript identifiers are case-sensitive.*/
