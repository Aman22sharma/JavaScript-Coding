### Use Bracket Notation to Find the Last Character in a StringPassed.
For example, if var firstName = "Charles", you can get the value of the last letter of the string by using firstName[firstName.length - 1].
Example:

    var firstName = "Charles";
    var lastLetter = firstName[firstName.length - 1]; // lastLetter is "s"
 Use bracket notation to find the last character in the lastName variable.

    var lastName = "Lovelace";
    var lastLetterOfLastName = lastName[lastName.length - 1];
    console.log(lastLetterOfLastName) //e
### Use Bracket Notation to Find the Nth-to-Last Character in a StringPassed
For example, you can get the value of the third-to-last letter of the var firstName = "Charles" string by using firstName[firstName.length - 3]
Example:

    var firstName = "Charles";
    var thirdToLastLetter = firstName[firstName.length - 3]; 
    // thirdToLastLetter is "l"
Use bracket notation to find the second-to-last character in the lastName string.

    var lastName = "Lovelace";
    var secondToLastLetterOfLastName = lastName[lastName.length - 2]; 
    console.log(secondToLastLetterOfLastName); //c
### Use bracket notation to find the second-to-last character in the lastName string.

    var lastName = "Lovelace";
    var secondToLastLetterOfLastName = lastName[lastName.length - 2];
    console.log(secondToLastLetterOfLastName); //c
